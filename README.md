###This is a work in progress. Please do not use!
This is a Spree extension to provide Right to left layout for rtl languages such as Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and others.

Installation
------------

Add spree_rtl to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_rtl'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_rtl:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_rtl/factories'
```
